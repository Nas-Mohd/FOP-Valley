Instuctions:
Write .txt file name it "majorsDesc.txt"
Separate 5 parts for the five majors.
Have each part start with identifier (ai, mmc, se, is, csn)
Then name of major Like "Artificial Intelligence"
then write a description and Include the spells in the description
After description have a line that just says stats.
After stats line, set the stats for each major. HP => ATTACK = > DEFENSE IN THIS ORDER
The stats should equal to 35 total, and HP should be multiplied by 2 when setting the stats.
FOR EXAMPLE, AI = 30 HP + 12 ATK + 8 DEF = 15 + 12 + 8 = 35 stat points
After setting stats, set the SCALING for each stat. HPSCALE => ATKSCALE=> DEFSCALE
The scaling should equal to 7 total and HPSCALE should be multiplied by 2 when setting.
FOR EXAMPLE, AI = 2 HPSCALE + 5 ATKSCALE + 1 DEFSCALE = 1 + 5 + 2 = 7 scaling.
After setting scaling list down the 3 spell names for the major then done and go to the next major.
